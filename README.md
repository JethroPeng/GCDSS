# GCDSS - Generalized Category Discovery in Semantic Segmentation

Welcome to the official repository for the [Generalized Category Discovery in Semantic Segmentation (GCDSS)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11525) project!

## Overview

This repository contains the code implementation for GCDSS. We are currently in the process of organizing and refining the codebase to make it more user-friendly. Currently, this is a preview version, and continuous optimization of the code will follow. This work is led by [Dr. Xin Tan (ECNU)](https://tanxincs.github.io/).

## Usage Instructions

### Preparing the Dataset

1. Place the Cityscapes dataset in the following directory:
   ```
   datasets/Cityscapes
   ```

2. Run the preprocessing script:
   ```python
   python preprocess.py
   ```

### Running the Main Program

- After preprocessing the data, you can run the main script:
  ```python
  python main.py
  ```

## To-Do

1. Organize and refine the self-training related code to enhance clarity and functionality.
2. Further streamline the code to make it more user-friendly.
